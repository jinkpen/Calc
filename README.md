================================================

This application is a simple rolling calculator
for Android OS, styled to look similar to the
calculator for iOS (version 11 and later). One
might even call the calculator iPhoney.

The calculator allows the user to view their input,
undo their input with the backspace button, toggle
whether their input operand is positive or negative,
and view their rolling calculation as they add more
operations.
